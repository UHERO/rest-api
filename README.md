# rest-api
REST API for UHERO Time Series

## Mock API

In the `mock-api` folder, run `npm install`. Then start the mock-api server with

```
$ NODE_ENV=development node index.js
```

This will start up the mock-api with stubs at http://localhost:8080

You can look at the API docs at http://localhost:8080/docs

When looking at examples in the documentation, you will need to replace `api.uhero.hawaii.edu` with `localhost:8080` to get valid results.
